## todos-react

This example was intentionally created in a complex way to have <i>realworld look and feel</i>. It shows `railway-effects` usage, handling async data, listening to events, effect and UI logic separation, testing code with effects and rendering optimizations for `react`.

Running the example:

- Install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) package manager if you don't have it:
  ```
  $ npm i pnpm -g
  ```
- Clone the whole repo:
  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:iyegoroff/ts-elmish.git
  ```
- Install dependencies and build packages:
  ```
  $ pnpm i && pnpm build -r
  ```
- Start this example:
  ```
  $ cd examples/todos-react && pnpm serve
  ```
